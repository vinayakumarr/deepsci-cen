Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham ([Amrita University](https://www.amrita.edu/)).

### About DeepSci 2017 Workshop

As most of you are aware deep learning is invading almost all arenas of science and technology. Out of them, healthcare happens to be the foremost. Recent developments in the field of healthcare utilizing the tools and techniques from deep learning formalism is creating a paradigm shift. Global giants such as Google and Microsoft are investing heavily in this direction.

Apart from the possibility of high quality publications, the research in this area will also open up excellent job opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students in various streams of engineering and sciences.

Yet another are where the efficacy of deep learning is beginning to get revealed is financial engineering. Compared to the classical methods used in financial engineering, tools of deep learning are extremely efficient to analyse and predict market dynamics. The research in market economy using the techniques of deep learning will result in patentable algorithms and also in start-ups with high potential for success.

The systems such as financial markets and human body which act as the source of data consist of many interacting subsystems. The traditional reductionist approach of analysing the individual subsystems is insufficient. A novel branch of physics termed Complex system theory is essential for the analysis of such large spatio-temporal data.

One of the most important open problems that grabs the attention of data scientists is the integration of measures derived from complex system theory with deep learning techniques. It will be highly revealing to view the deep learning formalism from a complex system perspective and also to effectively employ the complex measures as learning features for a deep learning network.

Considering the immediate need and the infinite potential of exploring the data from healthcare and financial sectors, Centre for Computational Engineering and Networking (CEN), Amrita School of Engineering, Amrita University Coimbatore has decided to conduct a one day work shop on **"Deep learning for complex systems with special focus on healthcare & finance"**.

**Venue: CEN, Amrita School of Engineering Coimbatore, Amrita University** 

**Registration is closed**
